# hello-world
My first repository on Git Hub
I have always been interested in technology, and I have so many ideas that  want to work on so I started to learn coding, which I fell in love with. Its like soccer, all you need is a ball and a place to play. With coding all you need is internet and a text editor and you can change the world. So now that I have a basic understanding of code I really want to start contriubing to open source projects to get practical experience.
